# ts-react-boilerplate
A boilerplate for a typescript react app, with minimal guts.

Feel free to fork and clone this repository and do whatever you would like with it. The intentions are to give a typescript ready react app
that will work instantly when running your start script. With that said, it is very bare-bones and may require additional setup on your end.

Happy Coding!
